conf.d
======
> Multi-files JSON loader

_Conf.d_ serves JSON documents obtained from static files and arbitrary paths passed by the user.  
According to the paths being passed and the way the files are organized in folders (and sub-folders), JSON docs are mixed together and bundled into one.

_Conf.d_ is to be used when there is a need for serving complex JSON documents, composed of default keys/values that can be overridden depending on arbitrary, runtime-picked criteria and loaded from a tree of files that reflects those possible override schemata.

Files and folders organization stays fixed, but JSON documents produced by _conf.d_ are dynamically generated starting from those files and the rules passed to _conf.d_.

Documents are unified by using the [unionj](http://github.com/NicolaOrritos/unionj) module.

## Warning
**Documentation still isn't complete**

## Install
```sh
$ npm install -g confd
```


## Example Usage
First of all prepare your JSON configuration file(s) (you need root rights to execute these):
```sh
mkdir -p /etc/conf.d/myinstancename
touch /etc/conf.d/myinstancename/conf.json
echo "{\"key\":\"value\"}" > /etc/conf.d/myinstancename/conf.json
```

Finally you can either use the command-line utility to read your JSON conf:
```sh
confd cli get /etc/conf.d myinstancename

# {"key":"value"}
```

Or you can expose them as a RESTful webservice:
```sh
confd rest --port 8080 --from /etc/conf.d

curl --get localhost:8080/confd/myinstancename

# {"key":"value"}
```

Or you can embed conf.d straight into your Node.js code:
```js
var confd = require('confd');
var conf  = confd.from('/etc/conf.d');
var obj   = conf.get('myinstancename');
console.log('Result is: "%s"', JSON.stringify(obj));
// Result is: "{"key":"value"}"
```
**Only when used as a node-module the result is an object instead of an actual JSON doc.**


## Paths
> [Coming soon]


## _"Common"_ documents
> [Coming soon]


## Strategies
_Conf.d_ offers two different strategies to load the configuration data:
- _Leaves_
- _Backcursion_

### Leaves
> [Coming soon]

### _Backcursion_
> [Coming soon]


## Next steps
- MongoDB docs loading
- New startegy: "Named Backcursion"
- RethinkDB docs loading
